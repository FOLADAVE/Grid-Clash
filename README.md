🎯 Design Decisions

Component-based architecture
Each part of the game (board, scoreboard, indicator, modals) is isolated into reusable components for clarity and scalability.

Smart CPU logic
The CPU prioritizes winning moves and blocks the player when necessary, making gameplay more challenging than random moves.

Responsive-first UI
Layouts adapt smoothly to smaller screens without sacrificing usability or visual appeal.

Subtle animations & sound effects
Enhances user experience without overwhelming gameplay.

Clean state management
Game state, turns, scores, and modes are handled efficiently using React hooks.
